# Bachelorarbeit

## Description
This project contains two prototypes which were created as part of my bachelor thesis by the topic 'User-Centered Development of a Transitional Interface for Text Input and Display within an AR-Application in the Urban Context'.

The two prototypes are:
1. The final prototype which functions as a proof-of-concept and was formally evaluated 
2. A Low-Fidelity prototype. This prototype represents the digital part of a more complex Low-Fidelity prototype (consisting of a mix of analog and digital elements).


## Requirements
The project was implemented in Unity 2020.3.33f1.
For the AR functionality AR Foundation 4.1.9 is being used.
The prototypes were adapted to a Huawei P20 (screen resolution: 1080 x 2240 pixels) running Android 12.
